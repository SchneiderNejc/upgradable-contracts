Introduction to Upgradable Smart Contracts

Why Upgradable Smart Contracts?

Smart contracts deployed on the blockchain are immutable by default. While immutability provides security and trustlessness, it also means that bugs, inefficiencies, or the need for improvements require deploying entirely new contracts. Upgradable smart contracts solve this problem by enabling modifications while maintaining state and user interactions.

Common Proxy Patterns

Upgradable contracts are typically implemented using proxy patterns. The key idea is to separate contract logic from storage by utilizing a proxy contract that delegates calls to an implementation contract. This allows the logic to be replaced without affecting stored data.

Key Proxy Patterns:

Transparent Proxy (ERC-1967) – The most widely used pattern, where only an admin can upgrade the contract, while regular users interact with the proxy normally.

UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) – A more gas-efficient variant where the implementation itself contains the upgrade logic.

Beacon Proxy – Uses a beacon contract to manage multiple proxy instances that all share the same implementation.

Security Considerations

While upgradable contracts offer flexibility, they introduce additional risks:

Storage Collision – Upgrading an implementation may unintentionally alter storage layout. Proper storage slot management (e.g., ERC-1967) is crucial.

Access Control – Only trusted parties should have permission to upgrade contracts to prevent malicious modifications.

Proxy Selector Clashes – Ensuring function selectors in the proxy contract do not interfere with delegated calls.
